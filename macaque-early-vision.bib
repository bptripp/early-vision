abstract = {The trichromatic primate retina parses the colour content of a visual scene into 'red/green' and 'blue/yellow' representations. Cortical circuits must combine the information encoded in these colour-opponent signals to reconstruct the full range of perceived colours. Red/green and blue/yellow inputs are relayed by the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of thalamus to primary visual cortex (V1), so understanding how cortical circuits transform these signals requires understanding how LGN inputs to V1 are organized. Here we report direct recordings from LGN afferent axons in muscimol-inactivated V1. We found that blue/yellow afferents terminated exclusively in superficial cortical layers 3B and 4A, whereas red/green afferents were encountered only in deeper cortex, in lower layer 4C. We also describe a distinct cortical target for 'blue-OFF' cells, whose afferents terminated in layer 4A and seemed patchy in organization. The more common 'blue-ON' afferents were found in 4A as well as lower layer 2/3. Chromatic information is thus conveyed to V1 by parallel, anatomically segregated colour-opponent systems, to be combined at a later stage of the colour circuit.},

@article{Callaway1998,
abstract = {▪ Abstract The basic laminar organization of excitatory local circuitry in the primary visual cortex of the macaque monkey is similar to that described previously in the cat's visual cortex (Gilbert 1983). This circuitry is described here in the context of a two-level model that distinguishes between feedforward and feedback connections. Embedded within this basic framework is a more complex organization. Within the strictly feedforward pathway, these circuits distribute unique combinations of magno-, parvo-, and koniocellular input from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to neurons in layers 2–4B. Their input is dependent on the extrastriate cortical areas they target. The local feedback connections from deep layers (5 and 6) arise from a diverse population of pyramidal neurons. Each type forms local connections with a unique relationship to more superficial layers. In the case of layer 6 neurons, these connections are closely related to layer 4 subdivisions receiving input from different functional st...},

abstract = {Collateralization of individual cortical axons is well documented for rodents but less so for monkeys, where double retrograde tracer experiments have tended to find only small numbers of neurons projecting to two different injection sites. Evidence from both double label and single axon studies, however, suggests that in specific projection systems the number of neurons with collateralized axons can be 10{\%} or greater. These include feedback projections from temporal areas (but less so those from V4 and MT/V5). Single-axon analyses show that many parietal neurons branch to multiple targets. Except for giant Meynert cells in area V1, feedforward projections from early visual areas have only a small number of neurons with branching axons. Why only some neurons collateralize, what determines branch points and projection foci, and how this impacts network organization are largely unknown. Deciphering the branching code might offer new perspectives on space-time organization at the network level.},

@article{Fitzpatrick1985,
abstract = {We have studied the intrinsic organization of macaque striate cortex by tracing the pattern of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled axons and cell bodies produced by microinjections of HRP into single cortical laminae. Both anterograde and retrograde transport results were used to examine: (1) the pattern of projections from lamina 4C to the superficial layers; (2) the projection from lamina 4C to deeper cortical layers; and (3) the projections to lamina 4C from other cortical laminae. Laminae 4C alpha and 4C beta differ in their pattern of projections to the superficial layers of striate cortex. Axons from neurons in lamina 4C beta ascend through lamina 4B without giving off collaterals and terminate in lamina 4A and in the base of lamina 3. By contrast, axons from neurons in lamina 4C alpha terminate in lamina 4B and less densely in the 4A/3B region. The projection from lamina 4C beta to lamina 4A is particularly dense and is distributed in a patchy fashion immediately above each injection site. The projection from lamina 4C beta to lamina 3B appears less dense and more widespread; we estimate that individual 4C beta axons may spread laterally for more than 400 micron. Furthermore, the pattern of HRP-labeled cell bodies in lamina 4C beta following injections into laminae 4A and 3B provides evidence for a subdivision within 4C beta. These injections always produce a large number of labeled neurons in the upper part of lamina 4C beta, whereas the lower portion contains few labeled neurons that are located immediately under the center of the injection site. Both lamina 4C alpha and lamina 4C beta also contribute less dense projections to the deeper layers of cortex. Lamina 4C beta projects mainly to lamina 6, whereas lamina 4C alpha contributes axon terminals to both lamina 5A and lamina 6. Neurons in lamina 6 provide the bulk of the intracortical projections to lamina 4C. The axons of these neurons are fine in caliber and have a delicate side-spine morphology that is quite distinct from lateral geniculate axon arbors. Neurons in lamina 5A also project onto lamina 4C, but the projections of these neurons appear concentrated in lamina 4C alpha. These results confirm or refine many conclusions about intrinsic connections of striate cortex drawn from Golgi material and suggest new patterns of connections not suspected from previous work.},

abstract = {Contrast-dependent changes in spatial summation and contextual modulation of primary visual cortex (V1) neuron responses to stimulation of their receptive field reveal long-distance integration of visual signals within V1, well beyond the classical receptive field (cRF) of single neurons. To identify the cortical circuits mediating these long-distance computations, we have used a combination of anatomical and physiological recording methods to determine the spatial scale and retinotopic logic of intra-areal V1 horizontal connections and inter-areal feedback connections to V1. We have then compared the spatial scales of these connectional systems to the spatial dimensions of the cRF, spatial summation field (SF), and modulatory surround field of macaque V1 neurons. We find that monosynaptic horizontal connections within area V1 are of an appropriate spatial scale to mediate interactions within the SF of V1 neurons and to underlie contrast-dependent changes in SF size. Contrary to common beliefs, these connections cannot fully account for the dimensions of the surround field. The spatial scale of feedback circuits from extrastriate cortex to V1 is, instead, commensurate with the full spatial range of center-surround interactions. Thus these connections could represent an anatomical substrate for contextual modulation and global-to-local integration of visual signals. Feedback projections connect corresponding and equal-sized regions of the visual field in striate and extrastriate cortices and cover anisotropic parts of visual space, unlike V1 horizontal connections that are isotropic in the macaque. V1 isotropic connectivity demonstrates that anisotropic horizontal connections are not necessary to generate orientation selectivity. Anisotropic feedback connections may play a role in contour completion.},

abstract = {In this brief review, I attempt an overview of the main components of anatomical laminar-level connectivity. These are: extrinsic outputs, excitatory and inhibitory intrinsic connectivity, and intrinsic inputs. Supporting data are biased from the visual system of nonhuman primates (NHPs), but I have drawn as much as possible from a broader span in order to treat the important issue of area-specific variability. In a second part, I briefly discuss laminar connectivity in the context of network organization (feedforward/feedback cortical connections, and the major types of corticothalamic connections). I also point out anatomical issues in need of clarification, including more systematic, whole brain coverage of tracer injections; more data on anterogradely labeled terminations; more complete, area-specific quantitative data about projection neurons, and quantitative data on terminal density and convergence. Postsynaptic targets are largely unknown, but their identification is essential for understanding the finer analysis and principles of laminar patterns. Laminar resolution MRI offers a promising new tool for exploring laminar connectivity: it is potentially fast and macro-scale, and allows for repeated investigation under different stimulus conditions. Conversely, anatomical resolution, although detailed beyond the current level of MRI visualization, offers a rich trove for experimental design and interpretation of fMRI activation patterns.},

Here we use rabies virus as a retrograde transynaptic tracer to show that the dorsal area MT receives strong input, via a single relay, from both M and P cells of the lateral geniculate nucleus. This surprising P input, likely relayed via layer 6 Meynert cells in primary visual cortex, can provide MT with sensitivity to a more complete range of spatial, temporal, and chromatic cues than the M pathway alone. These observations provide definitive evidence for P pathway input to MT and show that convergence of parallel visual pathways occurs in the dorsal stream.},

abstract = {We have exploited a technique for making small injections of horseradish peroxidase into single cortical laminae in order to study axonal projections in macaque striate cortex. In the preceding paper (Fitzpatrick, D., J. S. Lund, and G. G. Blasdel (1985) J. Neurosci. 5: 3329-3349) we examined the projections of cells in lamina 4C--cells that receive most of their input from the lateral geniculate nucleus. The present paper deals with the projections of neurons that lie outside of lamina 4C. Among our findings are several projections that previously had not been described in the monkey. These include: a strong and precise (point-to-point) projection from lamina 4B to lamina 2/3A, a reciprocal projection from 2/3A back to 4B, a definite projection from lamina 4B to 5B, as well as a prominent input to lamina 6 from 5B. In many cases, we find it possible to trace the flow of visual information through several "circuits" in striate cortex that have, as their output, projections to extrastriate cortex or to the brainstem. Our results offer additional insights in this regard since we are able, in many cases, to compare the lateral spreads of particular projections. These vary and can be separated into at least three categories: those that terminate in a precise, point-to-point, fashion, those that spread widely, and those that terminate in a laterally periodic fashion. In several cases we find evidence for a correlation between specific patterns of projection and known physiological differences between the topographies of laminae that are connected. In cases where two laminae possess similar topographies (for example, where both contain orderly maps for orientation) their interconnections appear precise, with little diffuse spread. In cases where two laminae are characterized by strikingly different topographies (where, for example, one contains an orderly map for orientation and the other a precise map for retinotopic position, but no specificity for orientation), the connections appear more diffuse.},

abstract = {Area V2 of macaque monkeys is traditionally thought to consist of 3 distinct functional compartments with characteristic cortical connections and functional properties. Orientation selectivity is one property that has frequently been used to distinguish V2 stripes, however, this receptive field property has been found in a high percentage of neurons across V2 compartments. Using quantitative intrinsic cortical imaging, we derived maps of preferred orientation, orientation selectivity, and orientation gradient in thin stripes, thick stripes, and interstripes in area V2. Orientation-selective responses were found in each V2 stripe, but the magnitude and organization of orientation selectivity differed significantly from stripe to stripe. Remarkably, the 2 pale stripes flanking each cytochrome oxidase dense stripe differed significantly in their representation of orientation resulting in their distinction as type-I and type-II interstripes. V2 orientation maps are characterized by clockwise and anticlockwise "orientation pinwheels", but unlike V1, they are not homogeneously distributed across V2. Furthermore, V2 stripes contain large-scale sequences of preferred orientation. These analyses demonstrate that V2 consists of 4 distinct functional compartments; thick stripes and type-II interstripes, which are strongly orientation selective and thin stripes and type-I interstripes, which are significantly less selective for orientation and exhibit larger orientation gradient magnitudes.},

@article{Maunsell1983,
abstract = {The cortical and subcortical connections of the middle temporal visual area (MT) of the macaque monkey were investigated using combined injections of [3H]proline and horseradish peroxidase within MT. Cortical connections were assigned to specific visual areas on the basis of their relationship to the pattern of interhemispheric connections, revealed by staining for degeneration following callosal transection. MT was shown to be reciprocally connected with many topographically organized cortical visual areas, including V1, V2, V3, and V4. These pathways link regions representing corresponding portions of the visual field in the different areas. In addition, MT has reciprocal connections with two previously unidentified cortical areas, which we have designated the medial superior temporal area (MST) and the ventral intraparietal area (VIP). The laminar distribution of terminals and cell bodies in cortical areas connected with MT follows a consistent pattern. In areas V1, V2, and V3, the projections to MT arise largely or exclusively from cells in supragranular layers, and the reciprocal connections from MT terminate mainly in supragranular and infragranular layers. In contrast, the projections to MST and VIP terminate mainly in layer IV, and the reciprocal pathways originate from cells in both superficial and deep layers. On the basis of this pattern, each connection can be designated as forward or feedback in nature, and a hierarchical arrangement of visual areas can be determined. In this hierarchy, MT is at a higher level than V1, V2, and V3, and at a lower level than MST and VIP. Subcortical projections were seen from MT to the claustrum, the putamen, the caudate nucleus, the inferior and lateral subdivisions of the pulvinar complex, the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, the superior colliculus, and the pontine nuclei.},

abstract = {Relationships between the M and P retino-geniculo-cortical visual pathways and "dorsal" visual areas were investigated by measuring the sources of local excitatory input to individual neurons in layer 4B of primary visual cortex. We found that contributions of the M and P pathways to layer 4B neurons are dependent on cell type. Spiny stellate neurons receive strong M input through layer 4Calpha and no significant P input through layer 4Cbeta. In contrast, pyramidal neurons in layer 4B receive strong input from both layers 4Calpha and 4Cbeta. These observations, along with evidence that direct input from layer 4B to area MT arises predominantly from spiny stellates, suggest that these different cell types constitute two functionally specialized subsystems.},

@article{Markov2014,
abstract = {Retrograde tracer injections in 29 of the 91 areas of the macaque cerebral cortex revealed 1,615 interareal pathways, a third of which have not previously been reported. A weight index (extrinsic fraction of labeled neurons [FLNe]) was determined for each area-to-area pathway. Newly found projections were weaker on average compared with the known projections; nevertheless, the 2 sets of pathways had extensively overlapping weight distributions. Repeat injections across individuals revealed modest FLNe variability given the range of FLNe values (standard deviation {\textless}1 log unit, range 5 log units). The connectivity profile for each area conformed to a lognormal distribution, where a majority of projections are moderate or weak in strength. In the G29 × 29 interareal subgraph, two-thirds of the connections that can exist do exist. Analysis of the smallest set of areas that collects links from all 91 nodes of the G29 × 91 subgraph (dominating set analysis) confirms the dense (66{\%}) structure of the cortical matrix. The G29 × 29 subgraph suggests an unexpectedly high incidence of unidirectional links. The directed and weighted G29 × 91 connectivity matrix for the macaque will be valuable for comparison with connectivity analyses in other species, including humans. It will also inform future modeling studies that explore the regularities of cortical networks.},
